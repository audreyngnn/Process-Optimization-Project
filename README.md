## Project Overview
This project documents the process optimization framework I developed during my time as HR Operations Lead at UAVS-NSW in 2021. It demonstrates how I used data-driven approaches and clear process mapping to improve team efficiency, reduce turnover, and scale operations.

## What This Project Shows
As an HR Analyst, I believe good people operations start with clear processes and smart delegation. This project showcases:

- **Process Mapping** – Breaking down complex team structures into clear, visual workflows
- **Task Delegation Framework** – Defining who does what, and when, to improve efficiency
- **Reporting Structures** – Creating accountability through transparent information flow
- **Conflict Resolution Process** – Building a fair, step-by-step approach to workplace issues

## Key Results
By implementing these optimized processes:
- **Doubled** application volume in 2021
- **Reduced turnover by 83%** through clearer role definitions and better communication
- **Improved task completion speed** by clarifying decision-making authority

## Process Components

### 1. Team Structure
Organized the team into **Core Team** (leaders) and **Sub-Teams** (specialized functions):
- Communications
- Content
- Logistics
- Business Development

### 2. Task Delegation Process
Created clear lines of communication:
- **Project Leaders** ↔️ **HRM** (two-way communication for alignment and approval)
- **Sub-team Leaders** ↔️ **Team Members** (one-way delegation for giving and receiving tasks)

### 3. Reporting Process
Established accountability flow from Team Members → Sub-team Leaders → Department Leader → Project Leader (PL1)

### 4. Information Flow
Mapped how information moves through the organization to ensure nothing gets lost

### 5. Conflict-Solving Process
Designed a 4-step escalation process with clear decision-making authority at each level
